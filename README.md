# Autoencoder Project

## Overview

The Autoencoder Project is designed to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of autoencoders in image compression and reconstruction. Using the MNIST dataset, this project builds and trains an autoencoder model to compress grayscale images of handwritten digits into latent representations and then reconstruct them to their original form.

### What is an Autoencoder?

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning. It consists of two main components:
- **Encoder**: Compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original input data from the compressed representation.

The goal of an autoencoder is to learn an efficient representation of the input data, capturing essential features while minimizing the reconstruction error.

## Project Components

- **Data Preparation**: Utilizes the MNIST dataset, a collection of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Images are preprocessed and transformed for use in the model.

- **Model Architecture**: The autoencoder is structured with an encoder to process and compress the input images and a decoder to reconstruct the images from the compressed representation. The network is designed to capture and reconstruct the essential features of the input images.

- **Training**: The model is trained using the MNIST dataset to minimize the difference between the original and reconstructed images. This involves optimizing the model parameters to improve the accuracy of the reconstruction.

- **Evaluation**: After training, the performance of the autoencoder is evaluated by comparing the reconstructed images to the original ones. This helps in assessing the quality of the learned representations and the effectiveness of the reconstruction.

- **Visualization**: Results are visualized by displaying original images alongside their reconstructed counterparts before and after training. This provides an intuitive understanding of the modelâ€™s performance and its ability to capture and reproduce key features of the input images.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the application of autoencoders in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It highlights the potential of autoencoders for image processing tasks, including compression, denoising, and feature extraction.
